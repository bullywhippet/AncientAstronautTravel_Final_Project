* Intergalactic E-Commerce 

Your company Ancient Astronaut Intergalactic Tours has been to the moon and back but is still working on a store front model and telephone reservations. We at KDW-Development recognize that you have been operating for thousands of years, but only officially incorporated in 1968. Intergalactic tourism has recently received a boost from the SpaceX publicity and it is natural that you would want to move towards an online sales system for your space travel packages. I understand that your offices are small employing under 20 people, and that your tour guides fluctuate as they operate on an Uber style model. As we have previously discussed, I understand that you like to think of your target demographic as “anyone with a credit card”, however I believe we should aim our marketing towards young professionals.
